# EuPlan Simplification Implementation Guide

This folder contains the step-by-step implementation guide for simplifying the over-engineered EuPlan application from a complex real-time collaboration system to a simple personal document editor.

## Overview

**Goal:** Transform from complex sync server architecture to simple Next.js-only architecture while keeping Y.js for excellent editor features.

**Timeline:** 3 days total
**Risk Level:** Low (pre-release app, no users to impact)

## Implementation Files

- `01_demolition_phase.md` - Delete sync server and remove WebSocket dependencies
- `02_core_rebuild.md` - Rebuild YjsProvider and persistence logic  
- `03_ui_simplification.md` - Simplify UI components and remove collaboration features
- `04_database_cleanup.md` - Simplify database schema and access patterns
- `05_testing_validation.md` - Update tests and validate functionality
- `06_final_cleanup.md` - Documentation updates and final optimizations

## Quick Start

1. **Backup First:** `git branch backup/pre-simplification`
2. **Create Working Branch:** `git checkout -b simplify/remove-sync-server`
3. **Follow Each Phase:** Work through 01-06 in order
4. **Test at Each Step:** Ensure app still works after each phase

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Sync server completely removed
- [ ] WebSocket dependencies eliminated  
- [ ] Y.js editor still works perfectly
- [ ] Auto-save functionality working
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Architecture Transformation

**Before:**
```
Browser ←→ WebSocket ←→ Sync Server ←→ PostgreSQL
```

**After:**
```
Browser → Next.js API → PostgreSQL
```

Start with `01_demolition_phase.md` and work through each phase sequentially.
