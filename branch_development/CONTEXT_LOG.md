# Context Log - Development Session Tracking

**Purpose**: Preserve development context across sessions to prevent loss of progress and decisions.

## ðŸ“… **Current Session**: 2025-01-03

### **Session Goals**
- [x] Complete comprehensive code analysis
- [x] Create development tracking system
- [x] Document analysis findings and recommendations
- [x] Create prioritized implementation plan
- [x] Complete ALL Priority 1 security fixes

### **Key Findings This Session**
1. **Security**: Critical hardcoded JWT secret identified (Priority 1)
2. **Quality**: TypeScript strict mode disabled in sync-server (Priority 1)
3. **Architecture**: Project is appropriately engineered, not over-engineered
4. **Performance**: Good foundation with specific areas for improvement

### **Decisions Made**
- Created `branch_development/` tracking system for context preservation
- Established 4-priority improvement framework (P1-P4)
- Prioritized security fixes for immediate implementation
- Documented comprehensive analysis in structured format

### **Next Session Priorities**
1. âœ… ALL Priority 1 security fixes COMPLETED
2. **P2.1**: Remove debug console statements from production code
3. **P2.2**: Implement React error boundaries for critical components
4. **P2.3**: Standardize error handling patterns across codebase

### **Files Modified This Session**
- Created: `branch_development/README.md`
- Created: `branch_development/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` 
- Created: `branch_development/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Created: `branch_development/CONTEXT_LOG.md`
- Created: `branch_development/PROGRESS_TRACKING.md`
- Created: `branch_development/DECISION_LOG.md`
- **SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**:
  - Modified: `apps/web/lib/jwt.ts` (removed hardcoded secret)
  - Modified: `apps/sync-server/tsconfig.json` (enabled strict TypeScript)
  - Modified: `apps/web/lib/db/schema.ts` (added lockout fields)
  - Modified: `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` (implemented account lockout logic)

### **Important Context**
- Project uses pnpm workspace with Turborepo
- Git not available in current environment (using file-based tracking)
- No tests should be broken during security fixes
- Maintain backward compatibility during improvements
