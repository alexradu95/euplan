# Branch Development Tracking

This directory contains development tracking documents to maintain context across sessions and coordinate implementation improvements.

## Directory Structure

```
branch_development/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md         # Summary of code analysis findings
├── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md      # Prioritized improvement plan
├── CONTEXT_LOG.md             # Session context preservation
├── PROGRESS_TRACKING.md       # Implementation progress tracker
└── DECISION_LOG.md            # Development decisions and rationale
```

## Purpose

This tracking system ensures:
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain development state across sessions
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear tracking of implementation progress
- **Decision Documentation**: Record architectural and technical decisions
- **Coordination**: Enable multiple developers to work effectively

## Usage

1. **Start of Session**: Review CONTEXT_LOG.md and PROGRESS_TRACKING.md
2. **During Development**: Update relevant documents as work progresses
3. **End of Session**: Update CONTEXT_LOG.md with current state
4. **Decision Points**: Document choices in DECISION_LOG.md

## Integration with Main Project

These documents complement the existing project documentation:
- Links to main CLAUDE.md for development guidelines
- References DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md for strategic direction
- Integrates with existing testing and quality processes
